## Building with Grunt

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) `~0.4.1` is used to build the project files. To get started, clone the project and then run:

- `npm install` to get the required node modules.
- `grunt --verbose` to confirm you have all the dependencies.


Read the Gruntfile to see the build tasks and relative directories of the source files.

Before contributing any code to the project, please take a look at the [Contributing](https://github.com/amsul/pick.js/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.




<br>
## Versioning

To maintain consistency in the sort of changes to expect with version bumps, [Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/) will be followed as closely as possible:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

Constructed as such:

- `major`: breaks backward compatibility (resets the `minor` and `patch`)
- `minor`: new additions with backward compatibility (resets the `patch`)
- `patch`: bug fixes and misc changes
